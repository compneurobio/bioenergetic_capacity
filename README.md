This repository contains scripts for analysis and figure generation of Arnold et. al. Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease (accepted), *Nature Communications*.

# Content
| Script name | Description | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-SGI_AD_traits.R | Acylcarnitine-based subgroup identification and association testing against AD traits | Supplementary Tables 1-4 and parts of Figure 2 |
| 2-SGI_Genetics.R  | Analysis of explained variance by genetic and potentially modifiable factors | Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 5-9, and Supplementary Figures 1 & 2 |
| 3-Epistatis_AD_traits.R | Test epistatic genetic effects of acylcarnitine-associated SNPs on AD | Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Figure 3 |
| 4-Bioenergetic_Age.R | Learn an prediction model for bioenergetic age and test this age metric for cross-sectional associations with AD | Figure 3, Supplementary Tables 11-15 & 19, Supplementary Figures 4-7, and data files for AGES and ADNI containing the predicted bioenergetic age variable |
| 5-Longitudinal_Analysis.R | Longitudinal analysis of modulation of cognitive decline through the bioenergetic age and genetic variants | Table 1, Figure 4, Supplementary Tables 16-18, and Supplementary Figure 8 |
